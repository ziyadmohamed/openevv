/* Text on its way from the caller into the engine.
 *
 * This is one function, addTextRun, and it is the longest in the object
 * because it is where five separate concerns meet: telling the caller
 * whether the voice went concatenative, wiring up the callbacks the first
 * time anything is said after a reset, letting a star command through
 * untouched, recoding the text if the SSML filter is in the way, and finally
 * handing what comes out to the romanizer a sentence at a time.
 *
 * The recoding is the bulk of it. The caller's text arrives as UTF-8 and the
 * engine wants single bytes, so there are two roads: with a romanizer
 * instance for this engine the text goes to UTF-16 and the romanizer maps it
 * down, and without one it is decoded here and the handful of code points
 * that have a place in the Windows Western byte set are put there. Text that
 * turns out not to be UTF-8 at all is copied across untouched rather than
 * mangled.
 *
 * Two things in here are the original's and are left as they are because
 * they are what it does: a local for a UTF-16 result that is never assigned
 * and so never used, and a flag set in every arm of the mapping table and
 * never read. */

       IBM's takes the caller's bytes as characters on this path: the code set
       only ever mattered under the SSML filter, which recodes above, and for
       the languages with a romanizer, which convert their own. Every letter of
       the nine it shipped is in the Western byte set, so nothing else needed
       saying. A language of ours can have letters that are not, and then a
       caller writing UTF-8 -- which is every caller now -- would hand over two
       bytes the machine reads as two characters.

       So a language that declares characters of its own gets its text
       converted here, and one that declares none is left exactly as it was.
       The nine IBM shipped declare none, which is what makes this safe rather
       than merely careful: their behaviour cannot change, and the suite says
       so. Text that is not UTF-8 after all is left alone by the converter
       itself. */
