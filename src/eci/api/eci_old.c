 * interface, the one whose entry points end in a two, and most of what this
 * layer does is hold a record of its own beside that one and hand the call
 * on. The record is what the older interface promised: a callback, a queue
 * the caller can fill before speaking, eight voices it can edit, and the
 * settings that go with them.
 *
 * Two things run through nearly every entry point. The first is a guard
 * against being called from inside its own callback: a call that arrives
 * while another is still running is refused, and the bit it would have used
 * is remembered so the layer above can tell what was missed. The second is
 * that the answer from underneath is turned into the older interface's own
 * notion of an error before anyone sees it.
 *
 * This is the first part of that object. Names are prefixed and the aliases
 * at the foot carry the real ones. */
