/* The romanizer manager.
 *
 * What this object is. The synthesis thread hands every scrap of text to a
 * romanizer manager before the engine sees it. For a language written in
 * another script that manager loads a romanizer and converts; for the rest
 * it is a pass-through that tidies the text and hands it on. US English
 * takes the second road, so the pass-through is live and matters, and the
 * conversion is dead.
 *
 * That was my mistake earlier in this work: I assumed a thing called a
 * romanizer was only for other scripts and stubbed the whole manager out.
 * The engine went silent. It is called seventeen times for addParam and ten
 * for processRemaining on a single sentence, and it is on the text path
 * proper.
 *
 * One finding worth keeping, and a correction to it. This file used to say
 * that getRomanizerInst loads a romanizer through Win32 LoadLibrary and
 * GetProcAddress, and that the loading half was therefore platform code to be
 * stubbed rather than transcribed. That is not what it does. It takes the
 * address of getRomObject, a link-time symbol that romedll_link.obj answers
 * when the romanizer is part of the program, and the only Win32 in it is
 * GetModuleFileNameA, asked for the directory the program was loaded from. So
 * it is transcribed below: eci_rom.h says what a romanizer is and
 * eci_romedll.c stands in for the linker's answer. getLibraryName is dead
 * either way -- it returns nothing at all in IBM's own code.
 *
 * Eight of its methods wear a tap, at the end of this file, matching the one
 * reference/romtap.c puts on IBM's own. Each public name is the wrapper and
 * the body beside it is a static, because IBM's tap is a rename across an
 * object boundary and so cannot see that object's own inner calls; ours has
 * to be blind to the same ones or the two dumps would not line up.
