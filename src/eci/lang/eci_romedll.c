/* Which romanizer is linked in.
 *
 * IBM's romedll_link.obj is one function, getRomObject, and it is what the
 * manager finds when the romanizer is part of the program rather than a
 * library beside it. The manager takes its address as a link-time symbol and
 * calls it for an instance; in a build with no romanizer the symbol is the
 * loaded library's instead, and in one with neither there is nothing to load
 * and the manager gets no instance.
 *
 * A binary of ours can hold several languages at once, so a link-time symbol
 * is not enough: two romanizers would have to answer to one name. Instead each
 * romanizer registers itself from its own language module, and this holds what
 * was registered. The manager asks by family and dialect and gets a maker or
 * nothing, which is the same question IBM's asks of the linker.
 *
 * Eighteen families of two dialects, indexed the way the manager's own arrays
 * are, so a family number means the same thing on both sides of the call.
