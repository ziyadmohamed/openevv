 * settings; three of those settings are also kept in a person's units and
 * are worked out here rather than stored.
 *
 * The settings file names each voice as a line of eight numbers under a key
 * of its own, so a section reads as one language and a run of Voice1 to
 * Voice8. The name is not in the file: the eight are always the same eight,
 * in the same order, and the original writes them in from a list.
