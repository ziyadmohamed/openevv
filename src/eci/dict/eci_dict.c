/* User dictionaries: making them, choosing them, and taking them away.
 *
 * A dictionary belongs to a language, and an instance may have one in force
 * for each language and dialect at once. That is what the table in the
 * middle of the instance is: eighteen families of two dialects, each holding
 * the dictionary currently active for it, or nothing.
 *
 * The table starts at the same offset as the queue the caller may fill,
 * which looks alarming until you notice that families are numbered from one,
 * so the family-nought slot is never touched by anything here and the queue
 * has it to itself.
 *
 * Loading a dictionary from a file and saving one to a file go through to
 * the volume calls the newer interface has, which the layer below has always
 * implemented.
 *
 * Reading a dictionary and writing to it are at the foot, and they are the
 * eight published calls that had no wrapper here until they were written out
 * of `eci.obj': the four questions -- look a key up, find the first entry,
 * find the next, change one -- each in a plain form and in the extended form
 * that carries a part of speech. Everything they lean on was already here;
 * what was missing was the glue.
 *
 * Names are prefixed and the aliases at the foot carry the real ones. */
